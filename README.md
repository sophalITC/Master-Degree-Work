- **AODE (Averaged One-Dependence Estimators)**: Enhances the probability estimation of Na誰ve Bayes by averaging over all models that assume a single attribute dependency.
- **Bayesian Network**: A probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph.
- **Na誰ve Bayes**: A simple probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (na誰ve) independence assumptions between the features.
- **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**: A powerful classifier that works well in high-dimensional spaces, using a hyperplane to separate different classes.
- **SMO (Sequential Minimal Optimization)**: An algorithm for solving the optimization problem of SVMs by breaking it down into 2D sub-problems.
- **Neural Network Back Propagation**: A multilayer perceptron training algorithm that updates the weights of neurons via a backward pass of error correction.
